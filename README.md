# Elecrow 1.28-inch and 2.1-inch rotary display examples (ESPHome and PlatformIO)

This repository contains sample code for the Elecrow 1.28-inch and 2.1-inch rotary displays, and the code was written for an [XDA article](https://www.xda-developers.com/esp32-powered-display-clock-rotary-display-elecrow/).

## Elecrow 1.28-inch display

The PlatformIO code for the Elecrow 1.28-inch demonstrates how LVGL 9.3 can be used on the display.

The ESPHome code for the Elecrow 1.28-inch implements all hardware features for a completely supported device in ESPHome, and displays a clock.

## Elecrow 2.1-inch display

The PlatformIO code for the Elecrow 2.1-inch demonstrates how LVGL 9.3 can be used on the display. The colors do not appear to be normal, though I am following the Elecrow example.

The ESPHome code for the Elecrow 2.1-inch implements all hardware features, though colors are not normal either.
